# Directory Bundle for Symfony

The Directory tool has been created for faster directory management. With it, you can quickly create a list of all files in a folder, create a new folder or generate a file path.

This bundle is compatible with Symfony 4.1 and Symfony 5.0. Symfony 3.4 compatibility abandoned.

## Installation

This bundle can be installed by Composer:
